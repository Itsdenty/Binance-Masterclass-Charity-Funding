# Binance Masterclass Final Project: Decentralized Charity Funding

### Summary

The project will empower people who need help to get funded via a decentralized platform. The project is proposing a platform that has three major players includimg the community token holder, the needy who create a donation account, and the donors who are majorly Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs) and angelic individuals.

### Major Players and Jusrisdiction

* The community token holders: Participate in voting funding profiles
* The Funding account: Opens donation account on the platform
* The Donors: People that want to donate to a specific profile.

### Decentralization Key Notes

*The platform will be driven by two unique tokens. 
*The voting token. This token will be used for voting and some other platform activities. The users earn the charity token rewards for using the voting token.
*The Charity token will be the actual valuable token. That can be used for actual donation and reward active community members.

### Talking points:
* How do we ensure people do not spam the voting system.
* How do we ensure there is enough incentives to buy the voting tokens beyond just the initial airdrops?
* Can there be any incentives for NGOs and donors?
* Whatâ€™s possible burning technique could help drive the token volume
